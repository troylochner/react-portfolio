## Troy Lochner Portfolio

This is my personal full-stack web development boot-camp portfolio.

 I am the Director of Content Workflow Systems for WWE (World Wresting Entertainment, Inc ); an integrated media organization and leader in global entertainment. In this position I am responsible for the development and deployment of software systems & processes vital to WWE's content production pipeline. I began my career at WWE as a content technician in February 2014 at the outset of the launch of WWE's award-winning OTT streaming service 'WWE Network'. In this early role at WWE I developed a database system which became critical to the operational workflow of distributing content to our network.

In my current role at WWE I have my hands involved in the creation and oversight of a wide range of systems; everything from a metadata mastering to creative request management, capital-expense tracking, production music licensing and media logging.

In 2020 I enrolled into a full-stack web development boot-camp as a way to broaden my development experience. I have been a database developer utilizing primarily FileMaker Pro for the better part of the last decade. With that as my base development background in terms of scripting and database design, I expanded into learning SQL/MySQL as well as some PHP so that I could begin to offer even more solutions to my end-users. Through the boot-camp process I have begun to have a greater understanding & appreciation of the work that goes into building a functional web-based front-end user experience.
